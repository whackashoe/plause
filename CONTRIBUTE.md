## Adding new features

* Open an issue to ensure double effort is not occuring
* Prefer explicit to implicit
* Create a feature branch

# Bug fixes

* You can help report bugs by filing them as issues
* Check to see the bug hasn't already been reported as an issue

* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if
** The bug is reproducible? Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)? What are the steps to reproduce? 
* You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are
happening

# Tests

* Currently no tests exist, this should be remedied.
